- **Dual loops.** Expansion decisions manage CapEx—renting structures, purchasing or replacing devices, unlocking cultivation methods—while daily operations juggle OpEx via climate control, irrigation, pest mitigation, staffing, and consumables.【F:docs/vision_scope.md†L112-L123】
- **Cost mechanics.** Maintenance costs rise with device wear, energy spend is derived from power draw per tick hour, water and nutrient purchases follow per-m²/day demand curves, rent multiplies hourly base rates by tick length, and labour costs respect overtime policies, ensuring all recurring charges scale with the current tick duration.【F:docs/system/simulation-engine.md†L173-L190】
- **Quality-driven revenue.** Harvest sales multiply base price by quality modifiers, with the quality model rewarding high health and low stress while a non-linear price function amplifies above-baseline quality and penalises poor output.【F:docs/vision_scope.md†L129-L195】
- **Design intent.** Persistent per-tick expenses maintain financial pressure so passive play is unviable, whereas mastering the systems to raise quality yields outsized rewards, reinforcing the tycoon-style tension.【F:docs/system/simulation_philosophy.md†L27-L31】
