# Title & Scope [ # Source: docs/vision_scope.md § 1. Vision; docs/backend-overview.md § 1. Purpose & Non-Goals ]

- **Weedbreed.AI** is positioned as a modular, deterministic cultivation simulation that spans structures, climate control, and plant lifecycles while remaining open and extensible through data-driven content contributions.【F:docs/vision_scope.md†L5-L17】
- The simulation core’s mandate is to deliver reproducible cultivation and economy modelling with structured telemetry and validated intent handling, keeping internal coupling hidden from clients.【F:docs/backend-overview.md†L3-L11】
- Experience pillars emphasise planning and optimisation of climate and lighting, risk management around pests and devices, and an economy loop that balances OpEx/CapEx, cash flow, and quality-driven pricing.【F:docs/vision_scope.md†L25-L29】
- Anti-scope guardrails exclude political or regulatory modelling, shooter-style mechanics, and lab-grade growth modelling so the project can favour plausible, playable systems over exhaustive realism.【F:docs/vision_scope.md†L19-L23】
