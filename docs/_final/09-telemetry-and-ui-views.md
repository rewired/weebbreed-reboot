- **Shared UI stream.** The backend exposes a hot observable that batches simulation updates, tick-completion notices, and domain events with bounded buffers; all transports subscribe to the same stream so Socket.IO and SSE clients receive identical JSON payloads in SI units.【F:docs/system/socket_protocol.md†L3-L31】
- **Handshake cadence.** On connect the gateway emits protocol metadata, current time status (tick, speed, pause state), and an initial `simulationUpdate` snapshot before continuing with batched updates that include phase timings, telemetry, and UUID-referenced entities.【F:docs/system/socket_protocol.md†L33-L145】
- **UI contract.** The dashboard renders read-only snapshots, routes every intent through the System Facade, and keeps unidirectional dataflow (render → intent → commit → event → re-render) so the engine remains authoritative.【F:docs/ui-building_guide.md†L1-L27】
- **Navigation model.** The application shells persist header controls, breadcrumbs, sidebar, and content area, supporting a structure → room → zone drill-down with responsive layouts, modal pauses, and consistent design-system primitives across breakpoints.【F:docs/ui-building_guide.md†L5-L111】
- **Global controls.** The dashboard header surfaces capital, cumulative yield, plant capacity, and tick progress, with play/pause, multi-speed presets, finance and personnel shortcuts, notification popovers, and menu actions that mirror telemetry events.【F:docs/ui-building_guide.md†L49-L127】
