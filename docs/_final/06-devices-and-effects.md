- **Device deltas.** Grow lights contribute heat proportional to power and map photon flux over coverage area to canopy PPFD, HVAC units steer temperature toward setpoints within hysteresis bands, dehumidifiers and humidifiers translate mass flow into relative humidity deltas, and CO₂ injectors push concentration toward targets capped by safety limits.【F:docs/system/simulation-engine.md†L35-L55】
- **Ambient normalisation.** After device and plant deltas, zones apply an exponential pull (`Δ = k_mix * (ambient − current)`) with airflow-dependent gain so ventilation hardware accelerates the return to ambient conditions.【F:docs/system/simulation-engine.md†L57-L59】
- **Blueprint parameters.** Device templates declare kind-specific settings (e.g., power, PPFD, coverage area, cooling capacity, airflow, targetTemperature, latent removal), quality and lifespan metadata, and allowed room purposes, giving the engine enough data to evaluate placement rules and runtime behaviour.【F:docs/DD.md†L203-L331】
- **Subsystem integration.** Lighting, climate/VPD, water/NPK, and energy subsystems derive their per-tick calculations from the declared device settings, enforcing validation such as positive PPFD, airflow bounds, and humidity limits before runtime use.【F:docs/backend-overview.md†L54-L64】
