# Domain Model [ # Source: docs/vision_scope.md § 4. Canonical Domain Model; docs/DD.md § 1) Strains — `/data/blueprints/strains/*.json`; docs/DD.md § 2) Devices — `/data/blueprints/devices/*.json`; docs/DD.md § 3) Cultivation Methods — `/data/blueprints/cultivationMethods/*.json` ]

- **Spatial hierarchy.** Structures contain rooms that contain zones; zones host plantings and the devices that condition their microclimate, mirroring the gameplay drill-down from buildings to individual plants.【F:docs/vision_scope.md†L84-L89】
- **Lifecycle coverage.** Plant entities progress from seed through vegetative and flowering stages into harvest and post-harvest handling, while devices degrade over time, requiring maintenance and replacement decisions.【F:docs/vision_scope.md†L90-L94】
- **Tick scale.** The simulation advances in fixed one-hour ticks (24 ticks per in-game day, 7×24 per week), anchoring telemetry aggregation, audits, and replays to tick identifiers.【F:docs/vision_scope.md†L95-L99】
- **Blueprint-backed entities.** Strains define genetics, environmental preferences, nutrient and water demand, phenology, resilience, and lineage; cultivation methods govern area per plant, spacing, labour intensity, and compatible traits; devices declare type-specific settings such as power, PPFD, airflow, temperature targets, and dehumidification rates.【F:docs/DD.md†L12-L115】【F:docs/DD.md†L203-L255】【F:docs/DD.md†L259-L331】
