- **Determinism first.** The simulation favours reproducibility over spectacle: every run uses seeded randomness, a fixed one-hour tick, and catch-up rules that prioritise fairness and responsiveness over raw step throughput.【F:docs/vision_scope.md†L13-L17】【F:docs/system/simulation_philosophy.md†L5-L8】
- **Emergent systems over monoliths.** Environment control is modelled as composable deltas (each device or plant contributes its own change), enabling extensibility and transparent root-cause analysis for players and developers alike.【F:docs/system/simulation_philosophy.md†L10-L12】
- **Stress → health → growth clarity.** Cultivation gameplay hinges on the player managing stressors so that health multiplies potential growth, making the optimisation loop explicit instead of opaque.【F:docs/system/simulation_philosophy.md†L14-L21】
- **Managerial control surface.** Autonomous employees claim tasks via utility scores so players focus on strategic decisions rather than micromanagement, aligning with the project’s indirect-control philosophy.【F:docs/system/simulation_philosophy.md†L23-L26】
- **Economic pressure with rewards.** Per-tick costs maintain constant tension while non-linear pricing amplifies high-quality harvests, rewarding mastery without relaxing deterministic accounting.【F:docs/system/simulation_philosophy.md†L27-L31】
- **Blueprint Doctrine.** Blueprints are delivered with the new repo as a validated set covering structures, room purposes, cultivation methods, strains, devices, pests, diseases, personnel roles, and price maps; they are immutable templates and are never instantiated directly, because runtime instances are created by copying a blueprint before the engine consumes them, which enables many simultaneous instances from a single template such as multiple small warehouses, rooms, or zones.【F:docs/backend-overview.md†L40-L52】
