# 08 NFR and Success Criteria

- Determinism, extensibility, observability, resilience, and configuration hygiene anchor the non-functional requirements for the simulation stack.【F:docs/re-reboot/source_documents/modular-plant-growth-simulation-prd.md†L126-L133】
- Performance success requires ≤100 ms compute per tick at 10 ticks/sec with specified fixture sizes, backed by a repeatable benchmark script.【F:docs/re-reboot/source_documents/modular-plant-growth-simulation-prd.md†L229-L231】
- Definition of Done demands working tests, responsive dashboard controls, validated save/load flows, and benchmark compliance before closing the milestone.【F:docs/re-reboot/source_documents/modular-plant-growth-simulation-prd.md†L266-L269】
