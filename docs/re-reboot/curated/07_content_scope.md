# 07 Content Scope

- Scope centers on a tick-based single-user simulation with runtime controls, telemetry visualization, and JSON save/load for the entire world model.【F:docs/re-reboot/source_documents/modular-plant-growth-simulation-prd.md†L33-L36】【F:docs/re-reboot/source_documents/modular-plant-growth-simulation-prd.md†L68-L117】
- Out of scope for v1 are 3D rendering, heavy CFD or psychrometrics, multiplayer logic, and database persistence, though the design keeps paths open for later upgrades.【F:docs/re-reboot/source_documents/modular-plant-growth-simulation-prd.md†L17-L21】【F:docs/re-reboot/source_documents/modular-plant-growth-simulation-prd.md†L83-L84】
- Open questions remain around psychrometric coupling, market modifiers, and default load targets, which should be tracked for future scoping decisions.【F:docs/re-reboot/source_documents/modular-plant-growth-simulation-prd.md†L260-L263】
