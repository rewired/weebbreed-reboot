# Environmental Simulation Constants

## Zone Sufficiency & Climate Control

`RECOMMENDED_ACH = 5`
The recommended number of air changes per hour for a zone to be considered to have optimal climate control.
`BASE_DEHUMIDIFICATION_LOAD_PER_M2_PER_H = 0.02`
The base amount of water vapor (in kg) that plants are expected to produce per square meter per hour, which dehumidifiers must counteract.
`BASE_CO2_INJECTION_PPM_PER_TICK_PER_M2 = 5`
The required rate of CO₂ injection (in ppm) per hour per square meter needed to maintain optimal levels against plant consumption and natural leakage.

## Ambient (External) Environment Conditions

`AMBIENT_TEMP_C = 20`
The default temperature (in Celsius) of the outside world that the zone's internal temperature will naturally drift towards.
`AMBIENT_HUMIDITY_RH = 0.50`
The default relative humidity (as a fraction from 0 to 1) of the outside world.
`AMBIENT_CO2_PPM = 400`
The default CO₂ concentration (in parts per million) of the outside world.

## Normalization & Physics Factors

`TEMP_NORMALIZATION_FACTOR = 0.1`
A multiplier determining how quickly a zone's temperature normalizes towards the ambient temperature each hour.
`HUMIDITY_NORMALIZATION_FACTOR = 0.05`
A multiplier determining how quickly a zone's humidity normalizes towards the ambient humidity each hour.
`CO2_NORMALIZATION_FACTOR = 0.1`
A multiplier determining how quickly a zone's CO₂ level normalizes towards the ambient CO₂ level each hour.

## Device & Plant Effect Factors

`LAMP_HEAT_FACTOR = 0.5`
A conversion factor that determines how much a lamp's power consumption (in kW) contributes to an increase in the zone's temperature (°C) each hour.
`COOLING_CAPACITY_FACTOR = 0.8`
A conversion factor that determines how much a climate unit's cooling capacity (in kW) contributes to a decrease in the zone's temperature (°C) each hour.
`DEHUMIDIFIER_HEAT_FACTOR = 0.2`
A conversion factor for the waste heat generated by a dehumidifier, determining how much its power consumption (in kW) increases the zone's temperature (°C) each hour.
`PLANT_TRANSPIRATION_RH_PER_PLANT = 0.00005`
The amount of relative humidity (as a fraction from 0 to 1) that a single plant adds to the zone each hour through transpiration.
`PLANT_CO2_CONSUMPTION_PPM_PER_PLANT = 0.2`
The amount of CO₂ (in ppm) that a single plant removes from the zone each hour during photosynthesis.

## Durability & Disease

`BASE_DURABILITY_DECAY_PER_TICK = 0.00002`
The base amount of durability that every active device loses each hour from wear and tear.
`BASE_DISEASE_CHANCE_PER_TICK = 0.0001`
The underlying random probability that any given plant might contract a disease each hour.
