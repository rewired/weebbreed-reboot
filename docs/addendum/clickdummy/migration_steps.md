## Data shape gaps vs PRD

1. GameData.globalStats exposes stringly-typed time and water metrics, whereas the dashboard contracts expect SimulationSnapshot.clock with numeric ticks and SI units (time status already modeled in stores).
2. Structure/room definitions omit required PRD fields (status, rent per tick, volumes, purpose metadata) found in StructureSnapshot/RoomSnapshot, so the migration must enrich fixtures with geometry and lifecycle attributes.
3. Zone records use local controls and KPI arrays with string values (e.g., humidity 52%) while the real schema expects normalized environment floats (0–1 relative humidity) and rolling metrics. Conversions and missing fields like volume, lighting, resources, health must be filled in or derived.
4. Plant objects rely on name/progress/harvestable while the PRD mandates strain IDs, stages, biomass, and linkage to structure/room IDs (PlantSnapshot).
5. Devices only expose name/type; backend contracts require blueprintId, kind, status, maintenance metrics, and settings payloads.
6. Personnel and candidate records lack morale/energy, salary-per-tick units, and optional seeds/gender present in PersonnelSnapshot types; salary semantics should switch from annual numbers to per-tick values.
7. Finance mock data summarizes “7d” figures and ad-hoc breakdowns rather than the tick-based FinanceSummarySnapshot and FinanceTickEntry history consumed by the live finance dashboard.

## Non-determinism & global state to replace

 1. SeededRandom is instantiated once at module scope; repeated calls mutate internal state and the global idCounter for deterministicUuid, meaning fixture generation order changes outputs. Swap for explicit seed management tied to store hydration or shared deterministic helpers.

2. App.tsx keeps the entire simulation in React component state and mutates copies with JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...)), which breaks determinism and bypasses the established Zustand slices (useGameStore, useZoneStore, etc.). Migration should funnel all state changes through the existing stores and intents to stay in sync with PRD expectations.

## Migration backlog

1. Define fixture-to-snapshot translator – Map initialMockData into SimulationSnapshot/store slices so clickdummy content can hydrate the Zustand stores without breaking type guarantees; normalize units and add missing PRD fields in this step.

2. Introduce deterministic helper module – Replace deterministicUuid/module-global RNG with a seeded helper integrated into store/utils, ensuring repeatable fixture generation and aligning with backend seeds.

3. Refactor layout shell – Extend App.tsx to render the real header/navigation/sidebar using existing design-system components, wiring controls to useGameStore for play/speed state and navigation slices for selections.

4. Port structure & room views – Implement structure/room detail pages leveraging DashboardOverview data, adding drill-down panels and breadcrumb logic derived from clickdummy while using normalized store selectors.

5. Enhance zone detail – Merge environment controls, plant grids, and device management into ZoneDetail, binding sliders/toggles to setpoint dispatch and using real telemetry values.

6. Integrate modal workflows – Register modal descriptors for CRUD/treatment flows in the modal slice and reimplement modal bodies with shared Modal while ensuring actions dispatch facade intents or update fixtures deterministically.

7. Rebuild personnel dashboard – Adapt hiring/roster UI to the live usePersonnelStore, translating morale/energy displays and hooking up modal-driven hires/fires using deterministic fixtures when backend data is absent.

8. Align finance UX – Incorporate clickdummy time-range controls and breakdown lists into FinancesView, ensuring metrics and charts consume normalized finance history from the store.

9. Finalize shared primitives & tests – Replace bespoke form/button/icon components with project-standard equivalents, add unit tests for new helpers/selectors, and verify seeded fixture snapshots remain stable.

## Open questions / risks

1. Do we continue using Material Icons from the clickdummy or switch to the project’s preferred icon set to stay consistent with the design system?

2. How should setpoint controls interact with the simulation facade—are sendConfigUpdate/sendFacadeIntent handlers already available for temperature, humidity, PPFD, etc., or do we need to extend store slices?

3. What navigation model should drive structure/room/zone selection—expand the existing navigation slice or introduce a dedicated world-browser slice? Clarifying avoids duplicating state between sidebar and top-level navigation.

4. Should personnel and finance fixtures represent per-tick values (per PRD) or retain aggregated “7d” placeholders until backend feeds real snapshots? Aligning units is critical for determinism and SI compliance.

5. Are duplicate/clone flows (rooms/zones) still required in the MVP, and if so, which backend intents will back them? Current clickdummy logic assumes immediate balance adjustments and device cost tables that may not exist yet.
